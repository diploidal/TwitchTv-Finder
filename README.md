# TwitchTv-Finder
## Check it out at [GitHub Pages](https://diploidal.github.io/TwitchTv-Finder/).
Simple page/webapp that fetches informations about user profiles on [Twitch.TV](https://twitch.tv).

An errors with responsiveness may occure.
I'm thinking about rebuilding it with Angular2 or ReactJS in near future. :-)

# Used technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (scripts for better UX)
- jQuery (Pulling AJAX data from Twitch.tv API)
- Twitch.TV Documentation/API [Twitch.TV](http://dev.twitch.tv)
- [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com) Becouse I love Material Design :-)

# Known issues
For some reason GitHub Pages does not work well with fetching stream `<iframe>` element in `STREAM` tab (I'm investigating problem).
# EDIT:
GitHub Pages does not allot to use embed videos (such as iframe object). It works perfectly fine locally or on other host.
